### Glyph Interface

Phone (3) users, you told us the Glyphs could use more love, so we got to work. We're excited to bring key refinements to Flip to Glyph to make the feature more customisable and impactful for daily use, along with refreshed versions of popular legacy Glyph features, reimagined for the Glyph Matrix. We hope you enjoy them!

🕒 Always-On Glyph Toys will now be activated with Flip to Glyph instead of on timeout, ensuring you always have a quick and reliable gesture to enable the toy of your selection. 

🤫 Added a setting to choose whether Flip to Glyph switches your phone to Silent or Vibrate mode.

⭐ Tooltip now clearly states that calls are not affected by the "Essential Notifications only" option under Flip to Glyph - no more guessing!

⚡While in Flip to Glyph, give your phone a quick shake while plugged in to instantly see the charging status. 


Next, let's go over the two most-requested legacy features:

🔗 The long-awaited Glyph Progress is back, now using Android 16 Live Update notifications for improved compatibility with third-party apps. Enable it via Settings > Glyph Interface > Glyph Progress.

⏳ Glyph Timer returns with a refreshed animation. Add it as a Quick Settings tile or enable it manually via Settings > Glyph Interface > Glyph Timer.


Last but not least, some features we at Nothing really wanted ourselves:

🌚 Introducing a new Moon Phase toy, showing exactly how the moon will look tonight.

🛝 Tired of the built-in toys? A new button on the “Manage Glyph Toys” page takes you directly to community-made creations on Nothing Playground.

📸 The Glyph Mirror toy will now also save a matrix-styled photo. Déjà vu? 

👖 The Glyph Interface will now temporarily disable when you put your phone in your pocket. No notifications are that Essential that they need to glow through your pants. 

We hope at least some of the features above can make their way to your daily routine, and please keep the constructive feedback coming!


## Notes:

The device may temporarily heat up and increase power consumption during the update and will quickly return to normal after the process is complete.
